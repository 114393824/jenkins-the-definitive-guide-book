    <para>Continuous Integration is a software development practice where
    members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person
    integrates at least daily â€“ leading to multiple integrations per day. Each
    integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect
    integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this
    approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a
    team to develop cohesive software more rapidly. This article is a quick
    overview of Continuous Integration summarizing the technique and its
    current usage.</para>
