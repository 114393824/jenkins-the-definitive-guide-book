      </indexterm>Continuous Integration without automated testing isn't
    really Continuous Integration - it's simply a small improvement on
    automatically scheduled builds. Indeed, if you are using Hudson without
    any automated tests, you are not getting anywhere near as much value out
    of your Continuous Integration infrastructure as you should.</para>

    <para>One of the fundamental tenants of Continuous Integration is that a
    build should be verifiable. It must be possible to objectively determine
    whether a particular build artifact is ready to proceed to the next stage
    of the build process, and the most convenient way to do this is by using
    automated tests. Without proper automated testing set up in your build
    process, you will find yourself having to retain many build artifacts and
    test them by hand, which is hardly in the spirit of Continuous
    Integration.</para>

    <para>In this chapter, we will see how Hudson helps you keep track of
    automated test results, and how you can use this information to monitor
    and dissect your build process.</para>

    <title>Integrating JUnit test results</title>

    <para>JUnit is the de facto standard of the Java world in unit testing
    tools.</para>

    <para>Hudson understands the JUnit test report format, and does an
    excellent job of displaying JUnit test results (see <xref
    linkend="fig-junit-test-result-trend" />).</para>
