      </indexterm>Hudson supports several security models, and can integrate
    with several user repositories. In smaller organizations, where developers
    work in close proximity, security on your Hudson machine may not be a
    large concern - you may simply want to prevent unidentified users
    tampering with your build job configurations. For larger organizations,
    with multiple teams, a stricter approach might be required, where only
    team members and system administrators are allowed to modify their build
    job configurations. And in situations where the Hudson server may be
    exposed to a broader audience, such as on an internal corporate website,
    or even on the Internet, certain build jobs may be visible to all users
    whereas others will need to be hidden to unauthorized users.</para>

    <para>In this chapter, we will look at how to configure different security
    configurations in Hudson, for different environments and
    circumstances.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Activating Security in Hudson</title>

    <para>Setting up basic security in Hudson is easy enough. Go to the main
    configuration page and check the 'Enable security' checkbox (see <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-enabling-security" />). This will display a number of
    options, that we will investigate in detail in this chapter. The first
    section, '<command>Security Realm</command>', determines where Hudson will
    look for users during authentication, and includes options such as using
    users stored in an LDAP server, using the underlying Unix user accounts
    (assuming, of course, that Hudson is running on a Unix machine), or using
    a simple built-in user database managed by Hudson.</para>

    <para>The second section, '<command>Authorization</command>', determines
    what users can do once they are logged in. This ranges from simple options
    like 'Anyone can do anything' or 'Logged-in users can do anything', to
    more sophisticated role and project-based authorization policies.</para>

    <para>In the remainder of this chapter, we will look at how to configure
    Hudson security for a number of common scenarios.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="hudson-security-simple">
    <title>Simple Security in Hudson</title>

    <para>The most simple usable security model in Hudson involves allowing
    authenticated users to do anything, whereas non-authenticated users will
    just have a read-only view of the build jobs. This is great for small
    teams - developers can manage the build jobs, whereas other users
    (testers, BAs, project managers and so on) can view the build jobs as
    required to view the status of the project. Indeed, certain build jobs may
    be set up just for this purpose, displaying the results of automated
    acceptance tests or code quality metrics, for example.</para>

    <para>You can set up this sort of configuration is to choose 'Logged-in
    users can do anything' in the Authorization section. There are several
    ways that Hudson can authenticate users (see <xref
    linkend="sec-identifying-users" />), but for this example, we will be
    using the simplest option, which is to use Hudson's own built in database
    (see <xref linkend="hudson-users-internal" />).. This is the configuration
    illustrated in <xref linkend="fig-hudson-enabling-security" />.</para>

    <para>Make sure you tick the 'Allow users to sign up' option. This option
    will display a 'Sign up' link at the top of the screen to let users create
    their own user account as required (see <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-user-signup" />). It is a good idea for developers to
    use their SCM username here: in this case, Hudson will be able to work out
    what users contributed to the SCM changes that triggered a particular
    build.</para>

    <para><figure id="fig-hudson-user-signup">
        <title>The Hudson Sign up page</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>This approach is obviously a little too simple for many
    situations - it is useful for small teams working in close proximity,
    where the aim is to know who's changes caused (or broke) a particular
    build, rather than to manage access in any more restrictive way.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="sec-matrix-security">
    <title>Matrix-based security</title>

    <para>Letting signed-in users do anything is certainly flexible, and may
    be all you need for a small team. For larger or multiple teams, or cases
    where Hudson is being used outside the development environment, a more
    sophisticated approach is generally required.</para>

    <para>Matrix-based security is a more sophisticated approach, where
    different users are assigned different rights, using a role-based
    approach.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Setting up matrix-based security</title>

      <para>The first step in setting up matrix-based security in Hudson is to
      create an administrator. <emphasis>This is an essential step, and must
      be done before all others.</emphasis> Now your administrator can be an
      existing user, or one created specially for the purpose. If you want to
      create a dedicated administrator user, simply create one by signing up
      in the usual way (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-user-signup" />). It
      doesn't have to be associated with an SCM user.</para>

      <para>Once you have your admin user ready, you can activate matrix-based
      security by selecting 'Matrix-based security' in the 'Authorization'
      section of the main configuration page. Hudson will display a table
      containing authorized users, and check boxes corresponding to the
      various permissions that you can assign to these users (see <xref
      linkend="fig-hudson-matrix-anonymous" />).</para>

      <para><figure id="fig-hudson-matrix-anonymous">
          <title>Matrix-based security configuration</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject role="web">
              <imagedata fileref="figs/web/hudson-matrix-anonymous.png"
                         width="4.3in" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>The special 'anonymous' user is always present in the table.
      This user represents unauthenticated users. Typically, you only grant
      very limited rights to unauthenticated users, such as read-only access,
      or no access at all (as shown in <xref
      linkend="fig-hudson-matrix-anonymous" />).</para>

      <para>The first thing you need to do now is to grant administration
      rights to your administrator. Add your administration user in the
      'User/group to add' field and click on 'Add'. Your administrator will
      now appear in the permissions matrix. Now make sure you grant this user
      every permission (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-matrix-admin" />), and
      save your configuration. You should now be able to log in with your
      administrator account (if you aren't already logged in with this
      account) and continue to set up your other users.</para>

      <title>Fine tuning user permissions</title>

      <para>Once you have set up your administrator account, you can add any
      other users that need to access your Hudson instance. Simply add the
      user names and tick the permissions you want to grant them (see <xref
      linkend="fig-hudson-matrix-users" />). If you are using an LDAP server
      or Unix users and groups as the underlying authentication schema (see
      <xref linkend="sec-security-ldap" />), you can also configure
      permissions for groups of users.</para>

      <para><figure id="fig-hudson-matrix-users">
          <title>Setting up other users</title>

          <mediaobject>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>You can grant a range of permissions, which are organized
      into several groups: Overall, Slave, Job, Run, View and SCM. Most of the
      permissions are fairly obvious, but some need a little more explanation.
      The individual permissions are as follows:</para>

          <listitem>

                  <para>Lets a user make system-wide configuration changes and
                  other sensitive operation, for example in the main Hudson
                  configuration pages. This should be reserved for the Hudson
                  administrator.</para>

                  <para>This permission provides read-only access to virtually
                  all of the pages in Hudson. If you want anonymous users to
                  be able to view build jobs freely, but not to be able to
                  modify or start them, grant the Read role to the special
                  'anonymous' user. If not, simply revoke this permission for
                  the Anonymous user. And if you want all authenticated users
                  to be able to see build jobs, then add a special user called
                  'authenticated', and grant this user Overall/Read
                  permission.</para>

      <title>Help! I've locked myself out!</title>

      <para>Now it may happen that, during this process, you may end up
      locking yourself out of Hudson. This can happen if, for example, you
      save the matrix configuration without having correctly set up your
      administrator. If this happens, do not panic - there is an easy fix, as
      long as you have access to Hudson's home directory, at least. Simply
      open up the <filename>config.xml</filename> file at the root of the
      Hudson home directory. This will contain something like this:</para>

      <para><programlisting>&lt;hudson&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.391&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;numExecutors&gt;2&lt;/numExecutors&gt;
  &lt;mode&gt;NORMAL&lt;/mode&gt;
  &lt;useSecurity&gt;true&lt;/useSecurity&gt;
  ...</programlisting>The thing to look for is the
      <code>&lt;useSecurity&gt;</code> element. To restore your access to
      Hudson, change this value to false, and restart your server. You will
      now be able to access Hudson again, and set up your security
      configuration correctly.</para>

    <title>Project-based security</title>

    <para>Project-based security lets you build on the matrix-based security
    model we just discussed, and apply it to individual projects. Not only can
    you assign system-wide roles for your users, you can also configure more
    specific rights for certain individual projects.</para>

    <para>To activate project-level security, select 'Project-based Matrix
    Authorization Strategy' in the Authorisation section of the main
    configuration screen (see <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-project-based-security" />). Here, you set up the
    default rights for users and groups, as we saw with Matrix-based security
    (see <xref linkend="sec-matrix-security" />).</para>

    <para><figure id="fig-hudson-project-based-security">

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>These are the default permissions, that apply to all projects
    that have not been specially configured. However, when you use
    project-based security, you can also set up special project-specific
    permissions. You do this by selecting 'Enable project-based security' in
    the project configuration screen (see <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-security-project-anon" />). Hudson will display a
    table of project-specific permissions. You can configure these permissions
    for different users and groups just like on the system-wide configuration
    page. These permissions will be added to the system-wide permissions to
    produce a project-specific set of permissions applicable for this
    project.</para>

    practical examples. In <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-project-based-security" />, for instance, no
    permissions have been granted to the anonymous user, so by default all
    build jobs will remain invisible until a user signs on. However, we are
    using project-based security, so we can override this on a
    project-by-project basis. In <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-security-project-anon" />, for example, we have set up
    the game-of-life project to have read-only access for the special
    'anonymous' user.</para>

    <para>When you save this configuration, unauthenticated users will be able
    to see the game-of-life project in read-only mode (see <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-security-readonly-project" />). This same principle
    applies with all of the project-specific permissions.</para>

    <para>Note that Hudson permissions are cumulative - at the time of
    writing, there is no way to revoke a system-wide permission for a
    particular project. For example, if the anonymous user has read-access to
    build jobs at the system level, you can't revoke read-only access for an
    individual project. So when using project-based security, use the system
    level matrix to define minimum default permissions applicable across all
    of your projects, and set up projects with additional project-specific
    authorizations.</para>

    <para>There are many approaches to managing project permissions, and they
    depend as much on organization culture as on technical considerations. One
    common strategy approach is to allow team members to have full access to
    their own projects, and read-only access to other projects. The
    '<command>Extended Read Permission Plugin</command>' is a useful extension
    to have for this scenario. This plugin lets you let users from other teams
    see a read-only view of your project configuration, without being able to
    modify anything (see <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-security-extended-read" />). This is a great way to
    share build configuration practices and tips with other teams without
    letting them tamper with your builds.</para>

    <para>Sometimes managing user permissions individually can be cumbersome,

    that way. A more recent alternative option is to use the 'Role Strategy
    Plugin', which allows you to define global and project-level roles, and
    assign these roles to users.</para>

    naming conventions in place for your project names (see <xref

    to create roles distinguishing developers with full configuration rights
    on their own project from users who can simply trigger a build and view

    automated deployment build jobs, but only production teams are allowed to

      <title>Using Hudson's built-in user database</title>

      <para>The easiest way to manage user accounts in Hudson is to use
      Hudson's internal user database. This is a good option if you want to
      keep things simple, as very little setup or configuration is required.
      Users who need to log on to the Hudson server can sign up and create an
      account for themselves, and, depending on the security model chosen, an
      administrator can then decide what these users are allowed to do.</para>

      <para>Hudson automatically adds all SCM users to this database whenever
      a change is committed to source code monitored by Hudson. These user
      names are used mainly to record who is responsible for each build job.
      You can view the list of currently known users by clicking on the
      'People' menu entry (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-user-list" />). Here,
      you can visualize the users that Hudson currently knows about, and also
      see the last project they committed changes to. Note that this list
      contains all of the users who have ever committed changes to the
      projects that Hudson monitors - they may not be (and usually aren't) all
      active Hudson users who are able to log on to the Hudson server.</para>

      To be able to log on to Hudson, the user account needs to be set up with
      a password. There are essentially two ways to do this. If you have
      activated the 'Allow users to sign up' option, users can simply sign up
      with their SCM user name and provide their email address and a password
      (see <xref linkend="hudson-security-simple" />). Alternatively, you can
      activate a user by clicking on the 'Configure' menu option in the user
      details screen, and provide an email address and password yourself, as

      address of 'joe@acme.com'), you can get Hudson to derive the email
      address from a user name by adding a suffix that you configure in the
      'Email Notification' section (see <xref
      linkend="fig-security-email-config" />). If you have set up this sort of

      following sections, we will look at how to hook Hudson up to other user
      management systems, such as LDAP repositories and Unix users and
      groups.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="sec-security-ldap">
      <title>Using an LDAP repository</title>

      <para>Many organizations use LDAP directories to store user accounts and
      passwords across applications. Hudson integrates well with LDAP, with no
      special plugins required. It can authenticate users using the LDAP
      repository, check group membership, and retrieve the email address of
      authenticated users.</para>

      <para>To integrate Hudson with your LDAP repository, Just select 'LDAP'
      in the Security Realm section, and fill in the appropriate details about
      your LDAP server (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-security-ldap" />). The
      most important field is the repository server. If you are using a
      non-standard port, you will need to provide this as well (for example,
      <filename>ldap.acme.org:1389</filename>). Or, if you are using LDAPS,
      you will need to specify this as well (for example,
      <filename>ldaps://ldap.acme.org</filename>)</para>

      <para>If your server supports anonymous binding, this will probably be
      enough to get you started. If not, you can use the 'Advanced' options to
      fine-tune your configuration. </para>

      <para>Most of the Advanced fields can safely be left blank unless you
      have a good reason to change them. If your repository is extremely
      large, you may want to specify a root DN value (e.g. 'dc=acme, dc=com')
      and/or a User and Group search base (e.g. 'ou=people') to narrow down
      the scope of user queries. This is not usually required unless you
      notice performance issues. Or, if your server does not support anonymous
      binding, you will need to provide a 'Manager DN' and a 'Manager DN
      password', so that Hudson can connect to the server to perform its
      queries.</para>

      immediately obvious. Suppose you have defined a group called
      'HudsonAdmin' in your LDAP repository, with a DN of
      '<code>cn=HudsonAdmin, ou-Groups, dc=acme, dc=com</code>'. To refer to
      this group in Hudson, you need to take the common name (cn) in
      uppercase, and prefix it with 'ROLE_'. So <code>cn=HudsonAdmin</code>
      becomes <code>ROLE_HUDSONADMIN</code>. You can see an example of LDAP

      <title>Using Microsoft Active Directory</title>

      <para>Microsoft Active Directory is directory service product widely
      used in Microsoft architectures. Although Active Directory does provide
      an LDAP service, it can be a little tricky to set up, and it is simpler
      to get Hudson to talk directly to the Active Directory server.
      Fortunately, there's a plugin for that.</para>

      <para>The 'Hudson Active Directory Plugin' lets you configure Hudson to
      authenticate against a Microsoft Active Directory server.</para>

      <para>The nice thing about this plugin is that it works both in a
      Windows environment and in a Unix environment. So if Hudson is running
      on a Unix server, it can still authenticate against a Microsoft Active
      Directory service running on another machine.</para>

      <para>More precisely, if Hudson is running on a Windows machine and you
      do not specify a domain, that machine must be a member of the domain you
      wish to authenticate against. Hudson will use ADSI to figure out all the
      details, so no additional configuration is required.</para>

      <para>On a non-Windows machine (or you specify one or more domains), you
      need to tell Hudson the name of Active Directory domain(s) to
      authenticate with. Hudson then uses DNS SRV records and LDAP service of
      Active Directory to authenticate users. </para>

      <para>Hudson can determine which groups in Active Directory that the
      user belongs to, so you can use these as part of your authorisation
      strategy. For example, you can use these groups in matrix-based
      security, or allow "Domain Admins" to administer Hudson.</para>

      Management and Single-Sign On (SSO) application from Atlassian that lets
      you manage single user accounts across multiple products. It lets you
      manage both an internal database of users, groups and roles, and
      integrate with external directories such as LDAP directories or custom
      user stores.</para>

      <para>Using the <command>Hudson Crowd Plugin</command>, you can use
      Atlassian Crowd as the source of your Hudson users and groups. Before
      you start, you need to set up a new application in Crowd (see <xref
      linkend="fig-hudson-security-cloud-app" />). Just set up a new Generic
      Application called 'hudson' (or something similar), and step through the
      tabs. In the 'Connections' tab, you need to provide the IP address of
      your Hudson server. Then map the Crowd directories that you will be
      using to retrieve Hudson user accounts and group information. Finally,
      you will need to tell Crowd which users from these directories can
      connect to Hudson. One option is to allow all users to authenticate, and
      let Hudson sort out the details. Alternatively, you can list the Crown
      user groups who are allowed to connect to Hudson.</para>

      as your Security Realm in the main Hudson configuration screen (see
      <xref linkend="fig-hudson-security-crowd" />).</para>

      groups defined in Crowd to set up Matrix-based security in the main

    <title>Keeping track of user actions</title>

    <para>In addition to configuring user accounts and access rights, it can
    also be useful to keep track of the individual actions that users
    performed: in other words, who did what to your server configuration. This
    sort of audit trail facility is even required in many
    organizations.</para>

    <para>There are two Hudson plugins that can help you do this. The Audit
    Trail Plugin keeps a record of user changes in a special log file. And the
    JobConfigHistory Plugin lets you keep a copy of previous versions of the
    various system and job configuration files that Hudson uses.</para>

    <para>The <command>Audit Trail Plugin</command> keeps track of the main
    user actions in a set of rolling log files. To set this up, go to the
    'Plugin Manager' page and select the 'Audit Trail Plugin' in the list of
    available plugins. Then, as usual, click on Install and restart Hudson
    once the plugin has been downloaded.</para>

    <para>You can set up the audit trail configuration in the Audit Trail
    section of the main Hudson configuration page (see <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-security-audit-trail" />). The most important field is
    the Log Location, which is where you indicate the directory in which the
    log files are to be written. The audit trail is designed to produce
    system-style log files, which are often placed in a special system
    directory such as <filename>/var/log</filename>. You can also configure
    the number of log files to be maintained, and the (approximate) maximum
    size of each file. The simplest option is to provide an absolute path
    (such as <filename>/var/log/hudson.log</filename>), in which case Hudson
    will write to log files with names like
    <filename>/var/log/hudson.log.1</filename>,
    <filename>/var/log/hudson.log.2</filename> and so forth. Of course, you
    need to ensure that the user running your Hudson instance is allowed to
    write to this directory.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>You can also use the format defined in the Java logging <ulink
    url="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/logging/FileHandler.html">FileHandler</ulink>
    class for more control over the generated log files. In this format, you
    can insert variables such as '%h', for the current user's home directory,
    and '%t', for the system temporary directory, to build a more dynamic file
    path.</para>

    <para>By default, the details recorded in the audit logs are fairly sparse
    - they effectively record key actions performed, such as creating,
    modifying or deleting job configurations or views, and the user who
    performed the actions. The log also shows how individual build jobs
    started. An extract of the default log is shown here:</para>

    trail is certainly useful, especially from a system administration
    perspective. However, it doesn't provide any information about the exact
    changes that were made the the Hudson configuration. Nevertheless, one of
    the most important reasons to keep track of user actions in Hudson is to
    keep tabs on exactly what changes were made to build job configurations.
    When something goes wrong, it can be useful to know what changes were done
    and so be able to undo them. The <command>JobConfigHistory
    Plugin</command> lets you do just this.</para>

    <para>The JobConfigHistory plugin is a powerful tool that lets you keep a
    full history of changes made to both job and system configuration files.
    You install it from the Plugin Manager in the usual way. Once installed,
    you can fine-tune the job history configuration in the <command>Manage
    Hudson</command> screen (see figure <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-security-confighistory-setup" />).</para>

    <para><figure id="fig-hudson-security-confighistory-setup">
        <title>Setting up Job Configuration History</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject role="web">
            <imagedata fileref="figs/web/hudson-security-confighistory-setup.png"

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>Here, you can configure a number of useful non-standard
    options. In particular, you should specify a directory where Hudson can
    store configuration history, in the 'Root history folder' field. This is
    the directory where Hudson will store a record of both system-related and
    job-related configuration changes. It can be either an absolute directory
    (such as '/var/hudson/history'), or a relative directory, calculated from
    the Hudson home directory (see <xref
    linkend="sec-hudson-home-directory" />). If you don't do this, job
    configuration history will be stored with the jobs, and will be lost if
    you delete a job.</para>

    <para>There are a few other useful options in the 'Advanced' section. The
    'Save system configuration changes' checkbox lets you keep track of
    system-wide configuration updates, and not just job-specific ones. And the
    'Do not save duplicate history' checkbox allows you to avoid recording
    configuration updates if no actual changes have been made. If not, a new
    version of the configuration will be recorded, even if you have only
    pressed the 'Save' button without making any changes. Hudson can also
    cause this to happen internally - for example, system configuration
    settings are all saved whenever the main configuration page is saved, even
    if no changes have been made.</para>

    <para>Once you have set up this plugin, you can access the configuration
    history both for the whole server, including system configuration updates,
    as well as the changes made to the configuration of each project. In both
    cases, you can view these changes by clicking on the 'Job Config History'
    icon to the right of the screen. Clicking on this icon from the Hudson
    dashboard will display a view of all of your configuration history,
    including job changes and system-wide changes (see figure <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-jobconfig-global-history" />).</para>

    <para><figure id="fig-hudson-jobconfig-global-history">

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>If you click on a system-wide change (indicated by the
    "(system)" suffix in the list), Hudson takes you to a screen that lists
    all of the versions of that file, and allows you to view the differences
    between the different versions (see figure <xref
    linkend="fig-hudson-jobconfig-config-history" />). The differences are
    displayed as 'diff' files, which is not particularly readable in itself.
    However, for small changes, the readable XML format of most of the Hudson
    configuration files makes this sufficient to understand what changes were
    made.</para>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>The JobConfigHistory plugin is a powerful tool. However, at the
    time of writing, it does have its limits. As mentioned, the plugin only
    displays the differences in raw 'diff' format, and you can't restore a
    previous version of a configuration file (those doing this out of context
    could be dangerous in some circumstances, particularly for system-wide
    configuration files). Nevertheless, it gives a very clear picture of the
    changes that have been made, both to your build jobs and to your system
    configuration.</para>
